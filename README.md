# C++ Practice projects

## Motivation
It's been a while since I've done anything with C++. So I'm doing some courses to freshen up on the language, and I'll keep the small projects/scripts I work on in here.

## List of projects
- Currency: A basic currency exchange. Enter a currency (from the supported list) and an amount, and it will convert to USD and add to your total. Do it as many times as you want, and then choose to quit to be shown your final total in USD.
- Rock Paper Scissors: Implementation of the game Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (as seen in "The Big Bang Theory"). Choose the number of rounds, and in each round select a choice to play against a randomly selecting CPU. At the end, receive your total points! (a tie is 0.5).
- Shapes: Refresher of basic OOP concepts. Creates a Shape class and some child classes that inherit from it, to showcase things like constructors, encapsulation/inheritance, polymorphism and abstractions. Also uses vectors to store the shapes and properly cleans up memory at the end.
